        <div class="about">
          literatura is a mobile app designed to promote the discovery and facilitate the study of classical works of
          literature.
          The app uses a collection of summaries and quizzes to help the user better know and understand important plot
          points and themes of each novel.
          literatura is a project worked on independently, from initial research to development.

        <div class="about text-right">
          There exists a vast number of works of classical literature that are culturally significant and worth
          studying/understanding.
          However, in this day and age, the only real exposure most students get is through the few books they are
          forced to read in their high school English courses.
          Despite increased accessibility to these books, the interest in them has been declining. This decline can have
          severe impacts on a young person's ability to comprehend
          the world around them, think critically and become involved in society.<br><br>

        <div class="about">
          To better understand the target audience, I interviewed past high school English teachers as well peers on their experiences in high school English, as. 
          Through these interviews,
          I tried to qualitatively get a sense of what made high school English classes insufficient in terms of "getting students
          into classical literature"
          and why the students themselves were unmotivated to study the novels assigned to them, much less go on their
          own and discover new ones. In the end, I came upon these key insights:
        </div>
        <div class="about">
          <ol>
            <li>Many students simply found other forms of electronic
              entertainment more enjoyable and easy to consume, creating instant gratification. These included TV
              shows/movies, video games, and social media.</li>
            <li>Building off of that, the world of classical literature seems foreign and strange, far removed from
              our modern world, causing a sense of unfamiliarity and fear for the majority of students.</li>
            <li>Even if a student decides to venture out into the world of classical literature, they can waste a
              lot of time digging through countless Wikipedia, Goodreads, Sparknotes, etc. articles, which can be confusing
              and discouraging, and not at all exciting.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <img class="headerimage" data-action="zoom" src="images/brunquote.png"><br>
        <div class="about">
          The takeaway here is that there is a large disconnect between the cultures of various time periods (in which
          classical literature was written) and now. On top of that, there is no easily accessible/centralized hub for
          all of the information for the few students that might want to have a go at studying classical literature.
          These two factors result in a very discouraging and uncomfortable environment for young people
          studying/attempting to study literature.

      <div class="work-box">
        <div class="text-left"><h2>Design approach</h2></div>
        <div class="text-right">
        <div class="about">Considering the above factors, the solution must:
          <ol>
            <li>Reframe classical literature in way where it can
              be integrated with modern culture and the digital age, providing gratification and comfort in a similar way.</li>
            <li>Provide a centralized and accessible hub that is easy for a student to navigate and understand,
              with the least amount of friction/time wasted.</li>
          </ol>
          Considering the fact that nearly every student now has a phone, it made sense to use a mobile app as the
          platform for this solution. I started drafting UI wireframes for the app on paper,
          including screens for information on books/authors (to inform) and screens for quizzes (to gamify and provide
          instant gratification).
          I got too excited and created some high-fidelity mock-ups right away in Figma, as seen below:
          <br><br><img class="headerimage" data-action="zoom" src="images/literaturav1.jpeg">
          <div class="caption-container">Ill-advised first attempt at mock-ups in Figma</div>
          <br>In hindsight, I was too hasty. I dove headfirst into Android Studio and started developing. While doing
          so, the lack of further planning and iterations
          became a large frustration. I ended scrapping the design entirely and starting from scratch. I redid the UI
          wireframes, along with a user flow diagram, and added the
          ability to "favourite" books, as an encouragement of sorts to actually go and read the book in the
          future.

          With a new design came a new color palette and fonts, this time with a set guide to prevent further
          frustrations. The color palette is mostly greyscale, with rustic brown accents to invoke the experience of
          reading an old book.
          I opted for Gills Sans as the font, calling upon the work of typographer Jan Tschichold when he came up with
          composition rules for publisher Penguin Books. The modern interface provides familiarity, while the typeface
          and colors
          create a cozy, vintage, time-honored feel. During the quiz, the user will get alerts, which should be exciting
          and gratifying, but muted enough to fit in with the rest of the colors.

          After several more rounds of explorations and iterations, I created high fidelity mock-ups using Figma. Afterwards I used Marvel to further communicate animations and user
          flow.
