            literatura is a mobile app designed to promote the discovery and facilitate the study of classical works of
            literature.
            The app uses a collection of summaries and quizzes to help the user better know and understand important plot
            points and themes of each novel.
            literatura is a project worked on independently, from initial research to development.

               <div class="about text-right">
                  There exists a vast number of works of classical literature that are culturally significant and worth
                  studying/understanding.
                  However, in this day and age, the only real exposure most students get is through the few books they are
                  forced to read in their high school English courses.
                  Despite increased accessibility to these books, the interest in them has been declining. This decline can have
                  severe impacts on a young person's ability to comprehend
                  the world around them, think critically and become involved in society.<br><br>

                  <div class="about">
                     To better understand the target audience, I interviewed past high school English teachers as well peers on their experiences in high school English, as. 
                     Through these interviews,
                     I tried to qualitatively get a sense of what made high school English classes insufficient in terms of "getting students
                     into classical literature"
                     and why the students themselves were unmotivated to study the novels assigned to them, much less go on their
                     own and discover new ones. In the end, I came upon these key insights:
                  </div>
                  <div class="about">
                     <ol>
                        <li>Many students simply found other forms of electronic
                           entertainment more enjoyable and easy to consume, creating instant gratification. These included TV
                           shows/movies, video games, and social media.
                        </li>
                        <li>Building off of that, the world of classical literature seems foreign and strange, far removed from
                           our modern world, causing a sense of unfamiliarity and fear for the majority of students.
                        </li>
                        <li>Even if a student decides to venture out into the world of classical literature, they can waste a
                           lot of time digging through countless Wikipedia, Goodreads, Sparknotes, etc. articles, which can be confusing
                           and discouraging, and not at all exciting.
                        </li>
                     </ol>
                  </div>
                  <img class="headerimage" data-action="zoom" src="images/brunquote.png"><br>
                  <div class="about">
                     The takeaway here is that there is a large disconnect between the cultures of various time periods (in which
                     classical literature was written) and now. On top of that, there is no easily accessible/centralized hub for
                     all of the information for the few students that might want to have a go at studying classical literature.
                     These two factors result in a very discouraging and uncomfortable environment for young people
                     studying/attempting to study literature.

               <div class="text-right">
                  <div class="about">
                     Considering the above factors, the solution must:
                     <ol>
                        <li>Reframe classical literature in way where it can
                           be integrated with modern culture and the digital age, providing gratification and comfort in a similar way.
                        </li>
                        <li>Provide a centralized and accessible hub that is easy for a student to navigate and understand,
                           with the least amount of friction/time wasted.
                        </li>
                     </ol>
                     Considering the fact that nearly every student now has a phone, it made sense to use a mobile app as the
                     platform for this solution. I started drafting UI wireframes for the app on paper,
                     including screens for information on books/authors (to inform) and screens for quizzes (to gamify and provide
                     instant gratification).
                     I got too excited and created some high-fidelity mock-ups right away in Figma, as seen below:

                     <br>In hindsight, I was too hasty. I dove headfirst into Android Studio and started developing. While doing
                     so, the lack of further planning and iterations
                     became a large frustration. I ended scrapping the design entirely and starting from scratch, sketching out some wireframes.

                     With a new design came a new color palette and fonts, this time with a set guide to prevent further
                     frustrations. The color palette is mostly greyscale, with rustic brown accents to invoke the experience of
                     reading an old book.
                     I opted for Gills Sans as the font, calling upon the work of typographer Jan Tschichold when he came up with
                     composition rules for publisher Penguin Books. The modern interface provides familiarity, while the typeface
                     and colors
                     create a cozy, vintage, time-honored feel. During the quiz, the user will get alerts, which should be exciting
                     and gratifying, but muted enough to fit in with the rest of the colors.
