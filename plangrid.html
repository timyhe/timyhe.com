          <div class="about">
            In the fall of 2019 (September - December), I had the opportunity to work at PlanGrid in San Francisco. PlanGrid builds field productivity and project management 
            software for the construction industry. In 2019, PlanGrid was acquired by Autodesk. During my time at PlanGrid,
             I was working on the Progress Tracking team, designing experiences to provide a single source of truth for the state of production on construction projects.

        <div class="about text-right">
          Construction companies don’t always meet their estimated budgets and timelines. Usually
          they realize this far too late to make any necessary adjustments. This leads to lost money
          and wasted work. Current methods of tracking progress are inefficient, disjointed, and do not
          keep crews accountable.

        <div class="text-left"><h2>Understanding existing workflows</h2></div>
        <div class="about text-right">
          I joined the team near the tail-end end of the initial research and discovery phase. Through said research, the team found that many of these current methods rely on gut 
          estimates while on the construction site, usually performed by the foreman, then reported to the project manager. This method relies heavily on personal experience, and is generally low accuracy. 
          As mentioned above, low accuracy methods result in skewed views of total progress, thus leading to lost money and wasted work. On the other end of the spectrum, we found methods of progress tracking that were very detailed and high accuracy. However, all of these methods required significant amounts of set-up and configuration by project managers, and were not mobile-friendly for field use. 
          The latter point leads to low adoption by most companies (in terms of these higher accuracy methods). <br><br>Interestingly enough, in the middle of the spectrum, there were methods in which companies would leverage pre-existing markup tools in PlanGrid to annotate sheets with visual representations of objects to track progress on. Updating the progress on these “objects” on the field would be as easy as changing their colors. 
          Unfortunately, this method doesn’t translate well to high accuracy data (which would then be used to calculate productivity rates and make appropriate adjustments). Despite that, seeing users employ this workflow presented great inspiration and an exciting opportunity for us.

              <li>Be quick and efficient for project managers to set up objects, and assign their associated activities (ie. create a “Wall” object type with associated activities “Framing”, “Rough-In”, “Closing”).</li>

        <div class="about text-right">
          After gathering the above requirements, our team began brainstorming different methods to meet them. I facilitated a two-part idea generation workshop (specifically for the “configuration” portion of the product) in which the cross-functional team (including product, design, user research, and engineering) all gathered together to sketch ideas. 
          This was particularly helpful as it brought together many different perspectives and pieces of knowledge I would have otherwise been unaware of.

          <div class="caption-container">Facilitating a sketching session for brainstorming</div><br>
          From there, alongside my product manager, we filtered down and expanded on a couple of key ideas, selecting the ones that were the most aligned with our given problem space and limitations. We were able to solidify requirements, make key design decisions, and iterate quickly. Sketches of multiple design options on pen and paper became low fidelity wireframes.

          <div class="caption-container">The result of the session: a lot of sketches</div><br>
          At this phase, I created a user flow diagram to get a better sense of how the requirements for configuration would be perceived by the user. Through this, I was able to get a lot of early feedback, better informing later design iterations.

        <div class="about text-right">
          After a few more rounds of iteration, I arrived at three main options for the first portion of configuration, setting up a construction project’s objects and activities. To be clear on explaining the three options, we must first clearly define objects and activities. At a high level, objects (such as walls) are items on the construction site to be worked on, while activities specify the particular tasks that need to be performed in order to track progress. Similar to the methods 
          PlanGrid customers were using existing markups capabilities for, activities are assigned specific colours in order to clearly represent progress on a sheet visually.

      <div class="about text-right">
        After establishing the layout, the process of creating and editing objects and activities needed to be designed. 
        To do this, I drew inspiration from two separate pieces of software, resulting in two more options with distinct approaches to user experience. One approach (left) was based upon existing PlanGrid creation patterns, including many modals and side drawers for editing. 
        The other approach followed design patterns (such as in-line editing and autosave) found in modern productivity apps like Todoist and Asana (right).

        I worked with the user researcher on my team to conduct 5 usability tests on these two different approaches. Through conducting the five user tests, we found that our customers enjoyed the new efficiency and ease of use provided by the modern approach, while others felt “safer” and more familiar with the current PlanGrid patterns. 
        In addition, said user testing qualitatively validated the practicality of our solution, as some customers deemed it a “game changer” for their construction teams. As such, our final solution incorporated elements of both approaches, combining the use of in-line editing with the familiar side-drawer. Using these mock-ups, I worked with our front-end engineers to build out and implement the designs.

      <div class="about text-right">There's a lot in store for Progress Tracking, considering that this project was only a proof-of-concept. Once more testing is done, more questions answered, and more hypotheses validated,
        the initiative will continue to be iterated upon and fleshed out. An exciting development for the near future is the release of <span class="hovertext1"><a href="https://constructionblog.autodesk.com/autodesk-build/">Autodesk Build</a></span>,
        the unified construction platform for Autodesk, combining the best parts of PlanGrid and BIM360 (Autodesk's existing construction software platform). As this initiative is released, there will need to be consideration on how this initiative will
        utilize the design system, both in terms of visuals and interactions.<br><br>I had an assumption that the in-line editing approach would be the ideal solution for its
        perceived efficiency. However, through user testing we found that familiarity was an equally
        important factor to users. This taught me the importance of testing and research-based
        decision making. Due to the nature of the project being an MVP, there was less of an
        emphasis on ironing out the visuals, though this is an area that I am looking to grow in and
        receive feedback for.<br>
