          <div class="about">
            In the fall of 2019 (September - December), I had the opportunity to work at PlanGrid in San Francisco. PlanGrid builds field productivity and project management 
            software for the construction industry. In 2019, PlanGrid was acquired by Autodesk. During my time at PlanGrid,
             I was working on the Progress Tracking team, designing experiences to provide a single source of truth for the state of production on construction projects.<br><br>

        <h2>Role and Overview</h2>
        <div class="about">
          I joined the team near the tail-end end of the initial research and discovery phase. Working with my product manager, design lead and researcher, I was able to synthesize some of the findings into insights. I was then able to facilitate a two-part sketching session with the whole team to brainstorm ideas. 
          <br><br>The next phase of the project involved working out more refined requirements with the product manager on our team, and then create low fidelity wireframes and sketches. Upon going through some iteration, we landed on two clickable prototypes with two different approaches. 
          <br><br>Along with the user researcher on our team, we conducted usability tests with sub-contractor project managers. After the testing, we were able to consolidate an approach, which led to high-fidelity mock-ups. I was able to work with the front-end developers on our team to implement the designs.
          Overall, this process took about 3 months, from October to December.
